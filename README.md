# Dataset Preview
This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were canceled.

# Analysis Insight
* The number of guests are more in city hotel, also the number of cancellation is more from the city hotel compared to the resort hotel.
* The majority of the guests original country of origin is from Europe, with a particular emphasis on Portugal, where the hotel is located.
* This is the distribution of guests who have both canceled and not canceled their bookings. Clearly, the number of guests who made their first-time bookings is higher than those who have rebooked, and the number of cancellations is also higher among the first-time bookings compared to the repeat bookings.
* It appears that the city hotel generally maintains higher prices than the resort hotel, which can be attributed to various factors such as the volume of bookings and the number of guests.
* The hotel have various time between confirming a reservation to their arrival date. Less management of lead time can effect the revenue of the hotel, so itâ€™s a good idea to encourage travellers to book comfortably ahead of time.
